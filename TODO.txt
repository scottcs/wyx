:::::::::::::::
:CURRENT TASKS:
:::::::::::::::

  + fix commands being dependant on which RunState we're in [e.g. MENU_LOAD_GAME should always go to the Load Game menu cleanly, without having to duplicate code in each RunState.]
  o read in-game keybindings from a config file. [make a default config in the data dir]
  o Level templates
  o   Be able to specify type of level construction, maps to use, enemies to use (by elevel, family, kind, etc), items to use. For example: mausoleum maps with skeletons and bone weapons, monastary maps with monks (any family) and magic armor, etc.
  + item distribution needs some algorithms [ensure even spread of weapons, armor, etc]
  o   poisson disk sampling for decoration/item/monster placement [map gen too?]
  ? How to handle map deformation? Would like ability to mine/dig/etc.
  - and another View that can show some representation of nodes on a level beneath the current one [for pits, chasms, digging down, etc].
  ? maptypes as composites?
  + map objects: map tiles like doors and stairs should be drawn above actual floor instead of incorporating floor into their tile [or should be objects rather than MapTypes]
  +   they should be collidable and send an event on collision [e.g. door collision asks entity if it has CanOpenDoors property, if so, sends DoorOpenEvent. trap collision triggers one of various TrapEvents.]
  o TileMapNodeView should listen for messages from its MapNode to determine if the node's type changed (for update() and _resetKey())
  o move stuff out from Level to Dungeon, Place or World [e.g. primeEntity, Turns, etc]
  - change Level representation of enemy to be by position in a table for faster lookup
  o dim area on screen should represent the hero's memory... entities and map objects should be drawn where they were last seen and in the state in which they were last seen. [no animation or updates]
  o make stairs work [generate new map]
  + maps should be referenced by ID like entities [with portals, anyway]

:::::::::::::::
:PENDING TASKS:
:::::::::::::::

Save/Load:
  Event Queues:
  o sanity checking; if data is corrupt or invalid, warn the user and load default values instead.
  o silently skip sections that are not supported. (for version compatibility). Warn the player when this happens [errm... but that's not "silently"].
  o tooltips on load menu buttons with more information

Entities:
  Components:
    o ExperienceComponent
    o   Level
    o   Total XP
    o   XP to next Level

  Items:
    o UsableComponent? [this needs scripting in JSON files]
    o   UseCommand [call onUse(), potentially destroy entity]

Input/Events/Config:
  o Close Door command

Console/Debug:
  - wizard mode

Expressions:
  ? how to implement scripting? Use a potion -> add x to health of containing mediator. Use a hammer -> knock back enemy. Sword occasionally sings?

    Example of use:
    "+USE_ENTITY": "@Owner:send(HEALTH_MODIFY, 12) @Destroy()",
    "+COMBAT_HIT": "@Target:send(KNOCK_BACK, 2)",
    "+TIME_TICK": "@OnChance(1, 10, @RandomChoice(%SayMessage))",
    "%SayMessage": {
      "Hey! Watup?",
      "Let me at em! Let me at em!",
      "Honk if you're horny!",
    },

Interface:
  TooltipFactory:
  +   Why does the numLines calculation sometimes come up short?

  ? Minimap  [or is zoom out good enough?]
  x Info bar [health bar, etc] [subclass Frame]
  x   optional Text as cur/max or as %
  x      can position text anywhere
  x   optional Text as label
  x      can position anywhere
  x   Dual-layer? background min/max/current as well? [could be used to show temporary gain/loss]
  x When paused, allow movement keys to move camera around map. When unpaused, camera follows primeEntity again.
  o colored numbers in tooltips
  x Tooltip line can be an InfoBar frame
  x custom mouse cursor
  x Quick Menu [post 0.1.0 probably... something to allow large inventory]

  Game viewport:
  ?   Context menu when right-click on entities/objects?
  ?   Click-to-move?

  Options / Config:
  o key bindings


Graphics:
  x support sprite batches if framebuffers are unsupported

  fix wrong dungeon colors after load:
  +    styles should be set in model, not in view [or do away with random styles and assign meaning to the tiles]

Sound:
  o music [randomly choose a track]
  o   option to disable
  o   option for volume
  o sounds
  o   option to disable
  o   option for volume
  o   monster hurt
  o   monster death
  o   player hurt
  o   player death
  o   open door

Other:
  x fix tests
  ? make EntityRegistry not a global [it's in the World]
