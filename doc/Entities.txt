Entities are a generic term for Heros, Enemies, and Items in Pud. An entity is
simply a collection of Components.

A Component is just some behavior and associated properties, wrapped up in a
re-usable container. See Components.txt for a list of currently available
Components and their properties.

To make a new entity, just create a new file in the appropriate directory, and
the game will see it. The format for entity files is fairly straightforward;
it's just the name of the entity and a list of the Components and properties
that you wish to override (that is, if you do not provide a Component or
property that the entity requires, a default will be supplied by Pud).

All entity files are written in a text format called JSON (see www.json.org
for info). This is a fairly simple format consisting of nested key-value
pairs. If an entity file is not valid JSON, Pud will error.

Here is an example of a very simple Enemy entity file,
"pud/entity/enemy/goblin.json":

{
	"name": "Goblin",
	"components": {
		"GraphicsComponent": {
			"TileSet": "char",
			"TileCoords": {
				"right": {"x": 1, "y": 6},
				"front": {"x": 2, "y": 6},
			}
		},
		"CombatComponent": {
			"Attack": 12,
			"Defense": 14,
		},
		"AITimeComponent": {
			"AttackCost": 1.5,
			"Speed": 0.5,
		},
		"CollisionComponent": {
			"BlockedBy": {
				"Wall": "ALL",
				"Door": "shut",
				"Stair": "ALL",
				"Trap": "ALL",
			},
		},
	}
}


Here is an example of a very simple Item entity file,
"pud/entity/item/broadsword.json":

{
	"name": "Broadsword",
	"components": {
		"GraphicsComponent": {
			"TileSet": "item",
			"TileCoords": {
				"normal": {"x": 3, "y": 1},
			}
		},
		"CombatComponent": {
			"AttackBonus": 4,
		},
	}
}
