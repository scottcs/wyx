Implement Components:
  - fix tests
	d add registry for entities
  + need a way to preload enemies and get by property (like "get random enemy with between 10 and 20 MaxHealth")
	o change Level representation of enemy to be by position in a table for faster lookup
  - support lua in properties when read from file
  o   InfoPanelComponent - just a guess here... mouseover info panel thingy
  o     AIInputComponent - AI routines, sends same messages as input component
  x InputSystem - ticks InputComponents
  x   - must also allow components to steal input [example: interface steals mouse click so that any components underneath do nothing] [I THINK]
  x AISystem - ticks AIComponents
  o UISystem - handles User Interface
  x CombatSystem - determines outcome of combat using CombatComponents

For v0.1.0:
  o monsters
  o combat
  o items
  o save/load
  o interface

Beyond v0.1.0:
  - maptypes as composites?
  o make stairs work [generate new map]
  - wizard mode
  - map as quad-tree [or something?]
  - poisson disk sampling for decoration/item/monster placement [map gen too?]
  o can hero background be transparent?
	o map tiles like doors and stairs should be drawn above actual floor instead of incorporating floor into their tile [or should be objects/entities rather than MapTypes]
	o TileMapNodeView should listen for messages from its MapNode to determine if the node's type changed (for update() and _resetKey())
  - make hero movement smoother [possibly only move camera when near edges?]
  x don't animate or update dim tiles
  x support sprite batches if framebuffers are unsupported
