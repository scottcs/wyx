# Wyx - A not-really-a-roguelike game made with Löve

I wanted to try making a roguelike game, and stumbled upon the open
source [Löve][1] framework, which provides Lua functions that abstract
the SDL game library. I decided to use this as well as a couple of Lua
libraries that add some nice OOP syntax to the language.

# How to run

Currently, Wyx will only work on **Mac OS X** and **Windows**, not
Linux. Even though Löve runs on Linux, Wyx uses a C library for random
number generation, which I've only compiled for Windows and OS X.

I'll provide some downloads, soon. You can download Löve yourself, and
then clone the repo and it should work. However, due to the required
compiled library, you might hit some snags.
