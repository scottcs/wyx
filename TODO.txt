:::::::::::::::
:CURRENT TASKS:
:::::::::::::::

  + fix items being duplicated on the ground sometimes
	d add debug line to entity tooltips
	d fix update lighting not updating at the right time on attach/detach
	d delete game from game-menu
	d make titles bigger
	d fix Z in fonts


:::::::::::::::
:PENDING TASKS:
:::::::::::::::

Save/Load:
  Event Queues:
  x change cwmc to offer a getCurrentSeed() which can later be used to set the seed to the same state. Possible?
  ? current state of queues? or just ignore?
  o sanity checking; if data is corrupt or invalid, warn the user and load default values instead.
  o silently skip sections that are not supported. (for version compatibility). Warn the player when this happens [errm... but that's not "silently"].
  o tooltips on load menu buttons with more information

Entities:
  o Fix ELevel weights
  o   Include MoveCost, AttackCost, etc
  o   Give player/hero ELevel
  o   be able to compare ELevels between types [e.g. if sword elevel > average hero elevel then it's an upgrade]

  Components:
    o ContainerComponent needs to keep track of position of contained entities and restore them on load [inventory items should be in the same place when the game is loaded].
    o ExperienceComponent
    o   Level
    o   Total XP
    o   XP to next Level

  Items:
    o UsableComponent? [this needs scripting in JSON files]
    o   UseCommand [call onUse(), potentially destroy entity]

Input/Events/Config:
  o read keybindings from a config file. [make a default config in the data dir]
	o Close Door command

Console/Debug:
  - log console to file (with an option)
  - maybe different levels of messages [only log certain lines?]
  - allow input and create some awesome commands
  - wizard mode
  + printing to Console while rendertarget is set to something else has strange implications

Level:
  o move stuff out from Level to Dungeon, Place or World [e.g. primeEntity, Turns, etc]
  - change Level representation of enemy to be by position in a table for faster lookup
  o dim area on screen should represent the hero's memory... entities and map objects should be drawn where they were last seen and in the state in which they were last seen. [no animation or updates]
  o Level templates
  o   Be able to specify type of level construction, maps to use, enemies to use (by elevel, family, kind, etc), items to use. For example: mausoleum maps with skeletons and bone weapons, monastary maps with monks (any family) and magic armor, etc.
  o make stairs work [generate new map]
  + maps should be referenced by ID like entities [with portals, anyway]
  + item distribution needs some algorithms [ensure even spread of weapons, armor, etc]

Expressions:
  ? how to implement scripting? Use a potion -> add x to health of containing mediator. Use a hammer -> knock back enemy. Sword occasionally sings?

    Example of use:
    "+USE_ENTITY": "@Owner:send(HEALTH_MODIFY, 12) @Destroy()",
    "+COMBAT_HIT": "@Target:send(KNOCK_BACK, 2)",
    "+TIME_TICK": "@OnChance(1, 10, @RandomChoice(%SayMessage))",
    "%SayMessage": {
      "Hey! Watup?",
      "Let me at em! Let me at em!",
      "Honk if you're horny!",
    },

Interface:
  TooltipFactory:
  +   Why does the numLines calculation sometimes come up short?

  ? Minimap  [or is zoom out good enough?]
  x perhaps a push() and pop() for RunState? [useful for Play -> PlayMenu -> Options, etc]
  x TooltipComponent... mouseover info panel thingy
  x   property.DrawStrategy (mouse, fixedPosition, leftOrRightScreenHalf)
  x   Add a description field to JSON files.
  x   And a Portrait field.
  x Info bar [health bar, etc] [subclass Frame]
  x   optional Text as cur/max or as %
  x      can position text anywhere
  x   optional Text as label
  x      can position anywhere
  x   Dual-layer? background min/max/current as well? [could be used to show temporary gain/loss]
  + When paused, allow movement keys to move camera around map
  + When unpaused, camera follows primeEntity again
  o comparison tooltips
  o colored numbers in tooltips
  x Tooltip line can be an InfoBar frame
  x custom mouse cursor
  x Quick Menu [post 0.1.0 probably... something to allow large inventory]

	Play Menu:
	o change Quit to Save and Quit [once we can quit without saving, from the console]

  StickyButton:
  x   Can watch a variable [for image it represents] -- is a "view" of an item

  Game viewport:
  ?   Context menu when right-click on entities/objects?
  ?   Click-to-move?

  Options / Config:
  o key bindings


Graphics:
  x make hero movement smoother [tweened... possibly only move camera when near edges?]
  - support sprite batches if framebuffers are unsupported

  fix wrong dungeon colors after load:
  +    styles should be set in model, not in view [or do away with random styles and assign meaning to the tiles]

Sound:
  o music [randomly choose a track]
  o   option to disable
  o   option for volume
  o sounds
  o   option to disable
  o   option for volume
  o   monster hurt
  o   monster death
  o   player hurt
  o   player death
  o   open door

Map:
  x map as quad-tree [or something?]
  ? maptypes as composites?
  o poisson disk sampling for decoration/item/monster placement [map gen too?]
  + map objects: map tiles like doors and stairs should be drawn above actual floor instead of incorporating floor into their tile [or should be objects rather than MapTypes]
  +   they should be collidable and send an event on collision [e.g. door collision asks entity if it has CanOpenDoors property, if so, sends DoorOpenEvent. trap collision triggers one of various TrapEvents.]
  ? How to handle map deformation? Would like ability to mine/dig/etc.
  o Create another View that can show simple representation of map nodes for Minimap.
  o and another View that can show some representation of nodes on a level beneath the current one [for pits, chasms, digging down, etc].
  o TileMapNodeView should listen for messages from its MapNode to determine if the node's type changed (for update() and _resetKey())

Other:
  - fix tests
  ? make EntityRegistry not a global [it's in the World]
