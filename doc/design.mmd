The player frequently makes meaningful andinteresting choices that will determine the outcome of combat with AIcontrolled enemies. The player also explores tile-based maps, revealingenemies and treasure, as well as other features and hazards, and willhave the ability to manipulate the battlefield to his advantage.All information about a battle is available to the player before theoutcome of the battle is decided. This includes enemy strength andabilities, terrain details, and full descriptions of the playercharacter's equipment, skills and spells.Combat======Combat is one of the major apects of the game. Patterns in positioning,skills and spells, and weapons determine which entities are attacked.Choices of skills, spells, and equipment determine damage and defense,as well as other effects. Attempting to move into a square that is occupied by an enemy willattack it using the attacker's currently equipped melee weapon (this iscalled *bumping*). The player has two weapon sets that can be swapped atany time (along with skills and spells), allowing for a variety ofsetups.Each weapon family (e.g. Axe, Sword, Mace) has a distinct attackpattern. The simplest attack pattern is just the single square that theenemy occupies. A more complex attack pattern might be the three squarescurrently "in front" of the attacker (determined by the direction of thebump), resembling a horizontal swiping attack.***Notes:***  * *The **only** means of using melee weapons is by bumping.*  * *Ranged weapons (such as bows, crossbows, wands) are available, but    are equipped in the Use slots and used manually, **not** by    bumping.*Example: Sword![Sword bumping up][sword1]![Sword bumping right][sword2]![Sword bumping up-right][sword3]Example: Axe![Axe bumping up][axe1]![Axe bumping right][axe2]![Axe bumping up-right][axe3][sword1]: image/sword_pattern1.png[sword2]: image/sword_pattern2.png[sword3]: image/sword_pattern3.png[axe1]: image/axe_pattern1.png[axe2]: image/axe_pattern2.png[axe3]: image/axe_pattern3.pngInterface=========![Interface Mockup][interface]  1.  **Hero Info**  2.  **Number of available health potions**  3.  **Status effects (buffs and debuffs)**  4.  **Six Use Slots**  5.  **Melee Weapon, Armor, and Accessory (Equipment) Slots**  6.  **Swap between two sets of Equipment and Use slots**  7.  **Inventory Slots**  8.  **Floor Slots**  9.  **Scroll buttons**[interface]: image/interface_mockup.png***Notes:***  * *The actual number of Use slots, Inventory slots, and Floor slots is    still to be determined.*  * *If there are more items on the floor than Floor slots, what    happens?*  * *It might look better if Inventory was a toggleable window, perhaps    in the center of the screen. The game would pause while it was    active. This would save space in the main panel, and would make it    easier to allow more inventory slots.*Entities========Heroes------The player can choose between a number of heroes, each with strengthsand weaknesses, as well as preferences for certain tactics over others.Enemies-------There are a large variety of enemies to fight. Each family of enemy willhave slightly different tactical tendencies. The different kinds ofenemies within a family will also have different tactics.For example, a Skeleton Warrior will charge straight toward the playerand attempt to bump head-on, while a Skeleton Mage will charge straighttoward the player until it is within spell throwing range and attempt tobombard the player from maximum range. Neither will run when hurt.In contrast, a Goblin Warrior will attempt to take cover behind pillarswhile making forward progress toward the player, and a Goblin Mage willstep out from behind barriers to cast spells, and then hide again. Bothwill run when below 10% health.Items-----### Weapons ###Each weapon family has a distinct tactical attack pattern, whether meleeor otherwise.### Armor ###Armor is primarily defensive in nature, although an armor item may haveany number of triggered effects (triggered when the defending characteris bumped) or passive effects (such as permanent buffs or debuffs whileworn).### Accessories ###Accessories can be either offensive or defensive in nature, or may evenbe strictly utilitarian. Rings, hats, cloaks, talismans --- these areall considered Accessories.### Consumables ###Health potions have a special slot in the interface, and don't take upinventory space. They can be used by clicking or by hotkey.Other consumables must be placed in a Use slot before being used.Skills and Spells=================Skills and Spells are found in the form of scrolls and books. These areplaced in a Use slot before being used. They may add additional patternsto melee attacks, or may provide extra defenses. They may have rangedattacks, or may manipulate the terrain, or perform any number of otheractions. They may buff the player character or debuff an enemy (or viceversa).Some examples:**Spin Attack:**![With a sword][spin1]![With an axe][spin2]![With a polearm][spin3][spin1]: image/spin_attack1.png[spin2]: image/spin_attack2.png[spin3]: image/spin_attack3.png***Note:***  *  Possibly, scrolls and books are consumable and stack, so that the     player has a stack in a Use slot, but a limited number of uses.
